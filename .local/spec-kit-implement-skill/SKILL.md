# Spec-Kit Implement Phase

Implement tasks in order.

## Prerequisites

- `tasks.md` exists and analysis is complete or explicitly waived.

## Steps

1. Work through `tasks.md` one task at a time.
2. Update the checkbox for each completed task.
3. Run relevant tests for each task or at logical checkpoints.
4. If you hit gaps in spec or plan, stop and request a return to the needed phase.
5. Provide a concise progress report.

## Output

- Code changes and updated `tasks.md`

## Example prompts

- "Implement the next unchecked task for ZOL-123 and update tasks.md."
- "Work through tasks for ZOL-456, run tests, and stop if spec gaps appear."
